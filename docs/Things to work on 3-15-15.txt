2. Multiple locations doesnt work.  
3. One step Check out:

a. When you log in and creeate a ship to address under My Account. It adds the address to the one step checkout page http://oemsupplies.com/demo/checkout/onestep/. If you look under the billing inforamtion it has too many addresses. Usually a customer will have only one billing address. Billig information should only have 1 option. They should be able to change the option
b. Also United States needs to be removed for all addressess.
